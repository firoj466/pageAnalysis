			JERUSALEM/GAZA (Reuters) -
			<span id="lw_1318376409_0" class="yshortcuts cs4-visible">Israel</span>
			and Gaza's Hamas Islamist rulers agreed on Tuesday to swap more than
			1,000
			<span id="lw_1318376409_3" class="yshortcuts cs4-visible">Palestinian prisoners</span>
			for Israeli captive soldier
			<span id="lw_1318376409_2" class="yshortcuts cs4-visible">Gilad Shalit</span>
			, resolving one of the most emotive and intractable issues between
			them.

			Israeli Prime Minister
			<span id="lw_1318376409_4" class="yshortcuts cs4-visible">Benjamin Netanyahu</span>
			, who won overwhelming cabinet approval for the lopsided exchange at
			a
			special night-time session, has been under constant public pressure
			to
			bring
			<span id="lw_1318376409_5" class="yshortcuts cs4-visible">Shalit</span>
			home. He said the soldier would be reunited with his family "in the
			coming days."

			Palestinians in the
			<span id="lw_1318376409_1" class="yshortcuts cs4-visible">Gaza Strip</span>
			greeted the agreement, brokered by
			<span id="lw_1318376409_7" class="yshortcuts cs4-visible">Egypt</span>
			and a German mediator, with celebratory gunfire. Hamas confirmed that
			it only remained to conclude technical arrangements for the trade.
		</p>
		<p>The breakthrough pact, after many false dawns in years of secret
			efforts to free Shalit since he was captured in 2006, has no direct
			bearing on Middle East peace negotiations.
		</p>
		<p>But it was likely to improve the climate for international efforts
			to restart peace talks. On the sidelines of the agreed swap, the
			United States said it was hopeful Israel and the Palestinians would
			hold a preliminary meeting to revive the negotiations on October 23
			in
			Jordan.
		</p>
		<p id="yui_3_3_0_1_1321406034501314">
			Prospects for peacemaking have been clouded by
			<span id="lw_1318376409_6" class="yshortcuts cs4-visible">Palestinian President Mahmoud
				Abbas
			</span>
			's request for U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state and by Israeli
			settlement expansion, which Abbas has said must stop if negotiations
			are to begin again.
		</p>
		<p>A source involved in the talks said the long-elusive pact had been
			mediated by Egypt. Its role is likely to strengthen Israel's ties
			with
			Cairo, which have suffered since the fall of Egyptian leader
			Hosni
			Mubarak in a revolution this year.
		</p>

		<p>Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal said Israel would release 1,027
			prisoners in two stages. Within a week, 450 will be swapped for
			Shalit
			and the rest will be freed two months later. Twenty-seven women
			are
			among those due to be freed.
		</p>
		<p>WHO WILL BE FREED?</p>
		<p>It was not immediately clear how many of the prisoners had been
			jailed for attacks that caused Israeli casualties. Under Israeli law,
			opponents of their release have at least 48 hours to appeal to courts
			to keep them behind bars.
		</p>
		<p>Yoram Cohen, head of Israel's Shin Bet internal security service
			told reporters 110 of the prisoners slated for release in the first
			stage would return home to the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Another
			131 would go to the Gaza Strip, where they reside. Six Israeli Arabs
			were also on the list.
		</p>
		<p>Cohen said 203 prisoners from the West Bank would be exiled to the
			Gaza Strip or abroad. The move appeared to be an attempt by Israel to
			prevent Hamas from regrouping in the territory, controlled by Abbas's
			Palestinian Authority.
		</p>
		<p>Two of the most famous Palestinian militants serving time in
			Israeli
			prisons are not part of the swap, Cohen said.
		</p>
		<p>He said he believed Hamas had softened its demands in the hope of
			winning favor with Egypt while unrest rocks Syria, a main ally of the
			group.
		</p>
		<p>Marwan Barghouti, a charismatic leader of Abbas's Fatah faction
			serving five life prison terms for murder, and Ahmed Saadat, found
			guilty of ordering the murder of Israel's tourism minister in 2001,
			will not be freed.
		</p>
		<p>While Shalit's parents have publicly campaigned for his freedom,
			relatives of Israelis killed in Palestinian attacks have lobbied
			Netanyahu not to give in to Hamas by releasing prisoners with blood
			on
			their hands.
		</p>

		<p>"Murderers are going free and we feel for their victims' families
			... but Gilad is coming home," said a woman in the tumult of a crowd
			who sang and danced at a protest tent that Shalit's family erected
			months ago near Netanyahu's residence.
		</p>
		<p>There 6,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails are regarded as
			heroes of the Palestinian struggle against Israeli occupation and
			quest for statehood.
		</p>
		<p>"We are happy with this great achievement and we thank our God for
			that. But our happiness is mixed with sorrow because we were not able
			to gain the freedom of all prisoners," Meshaal said in a televised
			address from Damascus.
		</p>
		<p>Israeli television quoted Netanyahu as telling Shalit's parents
			that, ever since he took office three years ago, "I've been waiting
			for the chance to make this telephone call" to inform them of the
			deal.
		</p>
		<p>Shalit's family had accused him of not doing enough to secure his
			release.
		</p>
		<p>Announcing to his cabinet, and television cameras, that a deal had
			been signed earlier in the day, Netanyahu said he feared time was
			running out for Shalit amid political upheaval in the Arab world.
		</p>
		<p>"I believe we have reached the best agreement possible at this
			time,
			when storms are raging in the Middle East. I don't know if we
			could
			have reached a better agreement, or even achieved one at all, in
			the
			near future," he said.
		</p>
		<p>"It's possible that this window of opportunity would have closed
			for
			good and we never would have brought Gilad home."
		</p>
		<p>In Gaza the families of men jailed for life by Israel waited to see
			if their names would be on the list. [nLE7LB3ZA]

		<p>Israel has carried out several lopsided prisoner swaps in the past,
			notably in 1985 when hundreds of Palestinian prisoners were freed in
			exchange for several soldiers captured by a guerrilla group in
			Lebanon. [nL5E7LB3S8]
